# WIP CrissCross Guest API for NodeJS applications
This is a helper package that allows Node applications to communicate with their
crisscross host servers.

It is not standalone and cannot be found on the npm registry

## How to use
Include this package in your node project to have access to the full features of
the xxhost application running locally for direct two-way communication with the
network as needed.

It is not necessary for many applications.
